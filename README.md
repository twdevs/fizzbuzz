This repository contains entries from the
"Variations on the Theme of Fizz Buzz" inspired meetup.

To add your code simply:

* let me (@jcinnamond) know if you don't already have access
* clone the repo (`git clone git@github.com:twdevs/fizzbuzz.git`)
* create a directory named after your github user (e.g., `jcinnamond`)
* create a subdirectory with a name that describes your code (e.g., `go-types`)
* copy your code in place
* add the files under your directory (`git add <your github username>`)
* commit the files (`git commit`)
* push the changes (`git push`)

Feel free to edit this file to make the instructions clearer. If you need any
help with git then contact me, post a question to the meetup discussions page
or ask at the next meetup.
